# Microservices Architecture: Key Components

Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that work together. Let's explore the essential components that make microservices work effectively.

## Core Components of Microservices

### 1. Service Components

- **Microservices**: Small, focused services that handle specific business functions
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point that routes requests to appropriate services
- **Service Registry/Discovery**: Keeps track of service locations and health
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across service instances

### 2. Infrastructure Components

- **Configuration Server**: Centralizes configuration management
- **Log Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes logs from all services
- **Distributed Tracing**: Tracks requests across multiple services
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures

## Spring Cloud Libraries for Microservices

| Component           | Spring Library                  | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| API Gateway         | Spring Cloud Gateway            | Routes and filters requests to services |
| Service Registry    | Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka     | Service registration and discovery      |
| Configuration       | Spring Cloud Config             | Centralized configuration management    |
| Circuit Breaker     | Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker    | Fault tolerance and resilience          |
| Distributed Tracing | Spring Cloud Sleuth             | Request tracing across services         |
| Log Aggregation     | Spring Cloud Sleuth with Zipkin | Centralized logging and monitoring      |
| Load Balancer       | Spring Cloud LoadBalancer       | Client-side load balancing              |

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability**: Scale services independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Isolated failures don't bring down the entire system
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Faster Deployment**: Smaller codebases enable quicker development cycles

In actual implementation, these components work together to create a robust microservices ecosystem that can handle complex business requirements while maintaining flexibility and resilience.

# Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

## What is SemVer?

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that provides meaning to version numbers. Created by Tom Preston-Werner (GitHub co-founder), it solves the "dependency hell" problem by establishing clear rules for how version numbers should be incremented.

## The SemVer Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

A SemVer version number consists of three components:

**1. MAJOR version (X.0.0)**

- Incremented when you make incompatible API changes
- Signals to users: "You'll need to update your code to use this version"
- Example: Adding authentication requirements to previously public endpoints

**2. MINOR version (0.X.0)**

- Incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- Signals to users: "New features available, but your existing code will still work"
- Example: Adding new optional parameters or endpoints

**3. PATCH version (0.0.X)**

- Incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
- Signals to users: "This fixes bugs but doesn't change functionality"
- Example: Fixing calculation errors or resolving security vulnerabilities

## Additional Labels

SemVer also supports pre-release and build metadata:

- **Pre-release versions**: `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta.1`, `1.0.0-rc.1`
- **Build metadata**: `1.0.0+20130313144700`, `1.0.0+21AF26D3`

## Common SemVer Tools

### Version Management Tools

1. [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - Standardized commit messages that automate versioning

   - `fix:` commits trigger patch versions
   - `feat:` commits trigger minor versions
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` commits trigger major versions

2. [**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) - Fully automates version management based on commit messages

## Best Practices

1. **Start at 0.1.0** for projects under initial development
2. **Release 1.0.0** when your API is considered stable
3. **Document all breaking changes** clearly in release notes
4. **Don't modify released versions** - each release should be immutable

## Create multiple docker containers for a simple web application

### Approach 1: Setup everything using docker commands

1. Setup the database container

```bash
# Create a custom network
docker network create myapp-network

# Create a volume for database persistence
docker volume create db-data

# Run a database container
# Not best practice tot include password here, just for demonstrate purpose
docker run -d \
  --name demo-db \
  --network myapp-network \
  -v db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:13
```

2. Build the web application container

```bash
# Build the web application container
docker build -t demo-app .
```

3. Run the web application container

```bash
docker run \
  --name demo-app-container \
  --network myapp-network \
  -d \
  -p 8080:3000 \
  -v ./logs:/app/logs \
  -e DB_USER=myuser \
  -e DB_HOST=demo-db \
  -e DB_NAME=mydb \
  -e DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  demo-app
```

4. Test the application

```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8080

# Get Items
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items

# Add Items
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/items -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Test Item"}'
```

5. Clean up

```bash
docker stop demo-app-container
docker rm demo-app-container
docker stop demo-db
docker rm demo-db
docker volume rm db-data
docker network rm myapp-network
```

### Approach 2: Use docker compose

#### Step 1: Create a basic docker-compose.yml file

1. Create a basic docker-compose.yml file

Here's a table of the basic components used in Docker Compose:
| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| networks | Defines how containers communicate with each other | `myapp-network` with bridge driver |
| volumes | Persistent data storage for containers | `db-data` for database persistence |
| services | Individual containers that make up the application | `demo-db`, `demo-app` |
| environment | Configuration passed to containers | `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` |
| ports | Maps container ports to host ports | `8080:3000` (host:container) |
| depends_on | Defines service dependencies | `demo-app` depends on `demo-db` |
| restart | Controls container restart behavior | `unless-stopped` |
| build | Location of Dockerfile for building images | `.` (current directory) |

2. Add the initial structure:

```yaml
networks:
  myapp-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
    name: db-data
```

#### Step 2: Add the database service

Now, let's add the PostgreSQL database service:

⚠️ Warning: Not a best practice to include password in the docker-compose.yml file, just for demonstration purpose.

```yaml
networks:
  myapp-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
    name: db-data

services:
  demo-db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: demo-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - myapp-network
    restart: unless-stopped
```

At this point, you can start just the database with:

```bash
# Start just the database
docker compose up -d demo-db

# Check that it's running
docker compose ps
```

#### Step 3: Add the web application service

Now let's add the web application service to the docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
networks:
  myapp-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
    name: db-data

services:
  demo-db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: demo-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - myapp-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  demo-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: demo-app-container
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    environment:
      DB_USER: myuser
      DB_HOST: demo-db
      DB_NAME: mydb
      DB_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
    networks:
      - myapp-network
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Step 4: Add service dependency

Let's add a dependency to ensure the database starts before the application:

```yaml
networks:
  myapp-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
    name: db-data

services:
  demo-db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: demo-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - myapp-network
    restart: unless-stopped

  demo-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: demo-app-container
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    environment:
      DB_USER: myuser
      DB_HOST: demo-db
      DB_NAME: mydb
      DB_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
    depends_on:
      - demo-db
    networks:
      - myapp-network
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Step 5: Running the stack

Now that the docker-compose.yml file is complete, you can run the entire stack:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up -d

# Check that all services are running
docker compose ps

# View logs from all services
docker compose logs

# View logs from a specific service
docker compose logs demo-app
```

#### Step 6: Testing the application

Test the application the same way as in Approach 1:

```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8080

# Get Items
curl http://localhost:8080/api/items

# Add Items
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/items -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Test Item"}'
```

#### Step 7: Clean up

When you're done, clean up all resources:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose stop

# Stop and remove containers, networks (but keep volumes)
docker compose down

# Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker compose down -v
```

## Key benefits of using Docker Compose:

- **Simplified management**: All configuration is in a single file
- **Service dependencies**: The `depends_on` parameter ensures the database starts before the app
- **Environment consistency**: The configuration is easily shared and versioned
- **One-command deployment**: Starts the entire stack with a single command
